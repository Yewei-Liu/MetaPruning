## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains the codes for our paper. We implemented the 3 experimenets in our paper (pruning ResNet56 on CIFAR10, VGG10 on CIFAR100, ResNet50 on ImageNet). You can also easily add other experiments based on our framework.

We have referenced the [Depgraph](https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning) codebase in part for our implementation. Thanks 😊.
